// You have to build a book directory where you would have to create endpoints using the 4 most basic methods: 
// GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
// You had to use GET for getting all books or only 1 book by id or all the books 
// under particular category.

// With the POST method, you can add a new book to the list and 

// need the PUT method for updating the existing book.

// With the DELETE method you can remove the book from the list.
// And for storing data you have to use MySql.
//   Example:
// Book1 is under history category
// Book2 is under Maths category
// Book3 is under Maths category.
